## Setup AWS account 

### AWS website 
    https://aws.amazon.com/
### Sign Up

    Email account
    Credit Card 
    ~50 us dollar budget for our project if GPU is in your plan

### AWS Deep Learning pre-built instance 
    https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B01M0AXXQB
    
### Steps to start a GPU instance in AWS 
    1) Sign up a AWS account with credit card bounded 
    2) Search for the Deep Learning AMI (free) by the link above
    3) Start a new instance from Deep Learnining AMI 
        1) US West (Oregon)	ami-296e7850 -> Lanuch with
        2) Enable public ip address
        3) select one of them 
            g2.2xlarge g2.8xlarge p2.xlarge p2.2xlarge p2.8large p2.16xlarge
        4) Security Group -> default 22, (optional) 8888 6006 port
        5) For storage, 50~100G is sufficient
        6) Create and download key-pair, such as "*.pem"
        7) run "ssh -i *.pem ec2-user@publicip"
        8) When in the instance, run "nvidia-smi" and "nvcc --version" to check the availbility of GPU
   4) Setup jupyter notebook https://blog.keras.io/running-jupyter-notebooks-on-gpu-on-aws-a-starter-guide.html        
### IMPORTANT NOTICE
